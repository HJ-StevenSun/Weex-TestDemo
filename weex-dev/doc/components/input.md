### Summary

The weex builtin component ``input`` is used to create interactive controls to accept data from users. How a ``input`` component works varies considerably depending on the value of its ``type`` attribute, such as ``text``, ``password``, ``url``, ``email``, ``tel`` etc.

**Notes:** `<input>` does not support the common-event `click`. Please listen to the `input` or `change` event instead.

### Child Components

This component supports no child components.

### Attributes

- `type`: &lt;string&gt; the type of controls to display. The default value is ``text``, if this attribute is not specified. Possible values are ``text``, ``password``, ``tel``, ``email``, ``url`` etc, each of which has the same meaning with w3c standard.
- `value`: &lt;string&gt; the value of the control.
- `placeholder`: &lt;string&gt; a hint to the user of which can be entered to the control. The placeholder text must have no carriage returns or line-feeds.
- `disabled`: &lt;boolean&gt; a boolean attribute indicates that the form control is not available for interaction. In particular, the click event will not be dispatched on disabled controls.
- `autofocus`: &lt;boolean&gt; a boolean attribute lets you specify that a form control should have input focus when the page loads.
- `maxlength`<sup class="wx-v">0.7</sup> :&lt;length&gt; a number value to specify maxlength of input
